<b>Problem Statement:</b> Telco's customer churn rate had been increasing gradually hence, the marketing manager wants to know the factor of customer churn before it
reaches its peak. So, this problem aims to analyze the data to determine what variables have the highest impact on the customer churn rate. The dashboard has a slicer to filter the churners and non-churners data. This dashboard gives a clear picture on category of customers and services which have 
caused the churn rate to increase.

<b>Important points of the analysis</b><br>

* The churn rate of Telco is approximately 26% of total customers and 25% of the churners are senior citizens. This may increase by time as it is the main concern of this analysis.<br>

* Majority of the churners have no dependents and are single(not married) which shows that the customers without commitents are tend to leave Telco compared to the ones with commitment.
* Apart from the demographics data, the services Telco provides has more impact on the rate of churn.

* As we can see majority of the churners using Electronic check for payment. As for the contract type, customers who are not bound to any kind of contract hold the majority bacause they are free to leave anytime.

* With higher monthly charge, customers won't able to stay longer with Telco so it's important to provide the right telco plan for the right person to retain the customers.

* By seeing this, we can easily say that Telco's Fibre Optic Internet Service need a fix and if they couldn't provide the best internet service the churn rate will keep increasing for sure. Because internet has became an intergral part of human life.
