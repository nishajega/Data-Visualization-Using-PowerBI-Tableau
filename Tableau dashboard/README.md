<b>Problem Statement</b>: Atlique hardware facing hard times with declining sales rate and the sales director couldn't track where the business is failing as he is not getting regular updates from their regional managers where their company branches are located. Because the managers are just sending the excel files in bulk and not giving any data insights. Hence, he came up with an idea of getting a picture of what's going on by creating dashboards because visualization is better than spreadsheet. So, he instructed the data team to analyse the data and come up with dashboards.
