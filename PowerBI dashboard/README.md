<b>Problem Statement:</b> Telco's customer churn rate had been increasing gradually hence, the marketing manager wants to know the factor of customer churn before it
reaches its peak. So, this problem aims to analyze the data to determine what variables have the highest impact on the customer churn rate. The dashboard has a slicer to filter the churners and non-churners data. This dashboard gives a clear picture on category of customers and services which have 
caused the churn rate to increase.
